- Leverage ShadCN for pre-built, customizable UI components (e.g., buttons, modals, cards).  

**Backend (Supabase):**  
- Store user data, music metadata, and subscription details in Supabase tables.  
- Use Supabase's real-time database for DMs and collaboration requests.  
- Implement role-based access control using Supabase's authentication system.  

**Deployment (Vercel):**  
- Deploy the app on Vercel for seamless CI/CD integration.
